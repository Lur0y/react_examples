# React Examples  

I use React a lot for work, but I havenâ€™t properly learned it in depth. I want to change that! I'll be taking some courses and documenting my progress here, focusing on solidifying my fundamentals and exploring best practices.

This repository contains a collection of examples Iâ€™ll create while learning React. The goal is to track my progress, explore different concepts, and build a reference for future use. Hope this is useful for meâ€”I'm pretty clueless! ðŸ˜…  

## What You'll Find Here  
- Examples of React fundamentals  
- Technical interview questions I typically use with trainees
- Experimentation with different libraries and tools  
- Useful patterns and techniques for real-world applications  
This repository is not meant as a beginner's guide but rather as a way to refine my understanding of React and explore advanced concepts over time.Mejor

## How to Use  
Feel free to browse through the examples, clone the repository, and run the projects locally. Each file contains explanations in the comments.  

## Getting Started  
Just clone the repo, install dependencies, and run a local server:  

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Lur0y/react_examples.git
cd react_examples
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Don't Forget  
If you use something like `"import.meta.env.VITE_BACKEND_DIR"`, make sure to add `*.env` to your `.gitignore` file. It's for your own securityâ€¦ and your backendâ€™s mental health. ðŸ˜†

## Folder structure I typically use
assets for images or resources, components for reusable components, pages for components that shows directly on a URL, logic for pure JS, context for react context. I also use the main for global imports and App for browser-router
