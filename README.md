# React Examples

I use React a lot for work, but I havenâ€™t properly learned it. I want to change that! I'll be taking some courses and documenting my progress here.

This repository contains a collection of examples Iâ€™ll create while learning React. The goal is to track my progress, explore different concepts, and build a reference for future use. Hope this is useful for meâ€”I'm pretty clueless! ðŸ˜…

## What You'll Find Here
- Examples of React fundamentals
- Typical technical interview questions I use with my trainee staff
- Experimentation with different libraries and tools
- Useful patterns and techniques for real-world applications

## How to Use
Feel free to browse through the examples, clone the repository, and run the projects locally. Each file contains explanations in the comments.

## Getting Started
Just clone the repo, install dependencies, and run a local server:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Lur0y/react_examples.git
